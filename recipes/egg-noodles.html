        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Egg noodles are, unsurprisingly, noodles made with eggs. Egg noodles have more flavor than noodles made with just flour, water, and salt. They also tend to be stickier and more flexible than noodles made without eggs.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Stir flour and salt together in a large bowl. Add eggs, milk, and butter.</li>
            <li>Knead dough until smooth, about 5 minutes. Let rest in a covered bowl for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>On a floured surface, roll dough out to a thickness of 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Cut into desired lengths and shapes.</li>
            <li>Allow to air-dry before cooking, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cook noodles in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
